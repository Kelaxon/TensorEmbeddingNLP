# Semi-supervised Text Classification via Tensor Embedding

## Method

* `load_data.py` loads raw text as a N by D index matrix

* `doc2vec.py` calculates tensor embeddings for each sentence

* `label_progagation.py` calculates labels with label propagation

## How to use

A complete working pipeline is shown in `example.sh`

## Note

* `tensor_toolbox` has its own license
